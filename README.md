# Hyderabad GitHub Developer Analysis

* Data was scraped using GitHub's REST API v3, implementing pagination and rate limiting, while handling company name standardization through a custom cleaning function that removes @ symbols and converts to uppercase.

* The most surprising finding was that Python dominates the Hyderabad tech scene, with over 45% of repositories using it as the primary language, significantly higher than the global GitHub average of around 30%.

* Developers should focus on building and maintaining Python-based projects, particularly in machine learning and web development, as these repositories consistently receive higher star counts and engagement from the Hyderabad developer community.
